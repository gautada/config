# neovim

This is the documentation for the [neovim](https://neovim.io) or nvim text 
editing environment.

**nvim** is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which 
itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and 
extension of vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none 
are vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of vim, and more.

This current implementation is based on 
[Josean Martinez's](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files) work
for how to [setup neovim](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vdn_pKJUda8&t=1412s).

## Features

### Plugin Manager

[packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) `use-package` inspired 
plugin/package management for neovim.

- This is installed via the `~/.config/nvim/lua/gautada/plugins-setup.lua`.
- Any changes to the plugins-setup.lua triggers the reload.

### Integrated Development Environment

This is a collection of plugins and settings that configure the environment 
across all devices and environments

#### File Explorer

[nvim.tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) is a file explorer for
neovim written in lua.

#### Status Bar

[lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) is blazing fast and 
easy to configure neovim statusline written in lua.

#### Terminal

Terminal is split between two mechanism, the defaul `:terminal` and 
**floatem**. 

[floaterm](https://github.com/voldikss/vim-floaterm) use (neo)vim terminal in 
the floating/popup window.

## Notes

### NvChad

- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) This is the previous enviroment 
settings being used.  This has been deprecated in favor of attempting to 
manually setup and document the nvim environment.

- Switching away from vimscript. To a lua based configuration. This is based
on [Josean Martinez](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files).
