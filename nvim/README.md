# neovim

This is the documentation for the [neovim](https://neovim.io) or nvim text editing environment.

**nvim** is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

## Features

[vim-plug](https://github.com/junegunn/vim-plug) is a minimalist Vim plugin 
manager.
