# neovim

This is the documentation for the [neovim](https://neovim.io) or nvim text editing environment.

**nvim** is a refactor, and sometimes redactor, in the tradition of Vim (which itself derives from Stevie). It is not a rewrite but a continuation and extension of Vim. Many clones and derivatives exist, some very cleverâ€”but none are Vim. Neovim is built for users who want the good parts of Vim, and more.

## Features

### Plugin Manager

[packer](https://github.com/wbthomason/packer.nvim) `use-package` inspired plugin/package management for Neovim.

- This is installed via the `~/.config/nvim/lua/gautada/plugins-setup.lua`.
- Any changes to the plugins-setup.lua triggers the reload.

### Integrated Development Environment

This is a collection of plugins and settings that configure the environment 
across all devices and environments

#### File Explorer

[nvim.tree](https://github.com/nvim-tree/nvim-tree.lua) is a file explorer for
neovim written in lua.

#### Status Bar

[lualine](https://github.com/nvim-lualine/lualine.nvim) is blazing fast and 
easy to configure neovim statusline written in lua.


#### Terminal

## Notes

### NvChad

- [NvChad](https://github.com/NvChad/NvChad) This is the previous enviroment 
settings being used.  This has been deprecated in favor of attempting to 
manually setup and document the nvim environment.

- Switching away from vimscript. To a lua based configuration. This is based
on [Josean Martinez](https://github.com/josean-dev/dev-environment-files).
